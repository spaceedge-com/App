They say, ‘Your foot can’t stand before our face; for your ancestors have been put to flight twice in their own land.’  <span class="verse" id="V73">73&#160;</span>Now you won’t be able to withstand the cavalry and such an army as this in the plain, where is there is no stone or pebble, or place to flee.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V74">74&#160;</span>Now when Jonathan heard the words of Apollonius, he was moved in his mind, and he chose ten thousand men, and went out from Jerusalem; and Simon his brother met him to help him.  <span class="verse" id="V75">75&#160;</span>Then he encamped against Joppa. The people of the city shut him out, because Apollonius had a garrison in Joppa.  <span class="verse" id="V76">76&#160;</span>So they fought against it.
