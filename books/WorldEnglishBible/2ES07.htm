What is now done was decreed when Adam transgressed my statutes.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then the entrances of this world were made narrow, sorrowful, and toilsome. They are but few and evil, full of perils, and involved in great toils.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For the entrances of the greater world are wide and safe, and produce fruit of immortality.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So if those who live don’t enter these difficult and vain things, they can never receive those that are reserved for them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Now therefore why are you disturbed, seeing you are but a corruptible man? Why are you moved, since you are mortal?  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Why haven’t you considered in your mind that which is to come, rather than that which is present?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then I answered and said, “O sovereign Lord, behold, you have ordained in your law that the righteous will inherit these things, but that the ungodly will perish.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The righteous therefore will suffer difficult things, and hope for easier things, but those who have done wickedly have suffered the difficult things, and yet will not see the easier things.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>He said to me, “You are not a judge above God, neither do you have more understanding than the Most High.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Yes, let many perish who now live, rather than that the law of God which is set before them be despised.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For God strictly commanded those who came, even as they came, what they should do to live, and what they should observe to avoid punishment.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Nevertheless, they weren’t obedient to him, but spoke against him and imagined for themselves vain things.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>They made cunning plans of wickedness, and said moreover of the Most High that he doesn’t exist, and they didn’t know his ways.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>They despised his law and denied his covenants. They haven’t been faithful to his statutes, and haven’t performed his works.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Therefore, Esdras, for the empty are empty things, and for the full are the full things.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For behold, the time will come, and it will be, when these signs of which I told you before will come to pass, that the bride will appear, even the city coming forth, and she will be seen who now is withdrawn from the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Whoever is delivered from the foretold evils will see my wonders.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For my son Jesus will be revealed with those who are with him, and those who remain will rejoice four hundred years.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>After these years my son Christ<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> “Christ” means “Anointed One”.</span></a> will die, along with all of those who have the breath of life<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Lat. man </span></a>.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then the world will be turned into the old silence seven days, like as in the first beginning, so that no human will remain.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>After seven days the world that is not yet awake will be raised up, and what is corruptible will die.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The earth will restore those who are asleep in it, and the dust those who dwell in it in silence, and the <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Or, chambers See 2 Esdras 4:35. </span></a>secret places will deliver those souls that were committed to them.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>The Most High will be revealed on the judgment seat, <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> The Syriac adds and the end will come. </span></a> and compassion will pass away, and patience will be withdrawn.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Only judgment will remain.

For who is there of those who are alive who has not sinned, and who of the children of men hasn’t transgressed your covenant?  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Now I see that the world to come will bring delight to few, but torments to many.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>For an evil heart has grown up in us, which has led us astray from these commandments and has brought us into corruption and into the ways of death. It has shown us the paths of perdition and removed us far from life—and that, not a few only, but nearly all who have been created.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>He answered me, “Listen to me, and I will instruct you.

Let all who are born lament, but let the four-footed animals and the livestock rejoice.  <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>For it is far better with them than with us; for they don’t look forward to judgment, neither do they know of torments or of salvation promised to them after death.  <span class="verse" id="V67">67&#160;</span>For what does it profit us, that we will be preserved alive, but yet be afflicted with torment?  <span class="verse" id="V68">68&#160;</span>For all who are born are defiled with iniquities, and are full of sins and laden with transgressions.  <span class="verse" id="V69">69&#160;</span>If after death we were not to come into judgment, perhaps it would have been better for us.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V70">70&#160;</span>He answered me, “When the Most High made the world and Adam and all those who came from him, he first prepared the judgment and the things that pertain to the judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V71">71&#160;</span>Now understand from your own words, for you have said that the mind grows with us.  <span class="verse" id="V72">72&#160;</span>They therefore who dwell on the earth will be tormented for this reason, that having understanding they have committed iniquity, and receiving commandments have not kept them, and having obtained a law they dealt unfaithfully with that which they received.  <span class="verse" id="V73">73&#160;</span>What then will they have to say in the judgment, or how will they answer in the last times?  <span class="verse" id="V74">74&#160;</span>For how long a time has the Most High been patient with those who inhabit the world, and not for their sakes, but because of the times which he has foreordained!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V75">75&#160;</span>I answered, “If I have found grace in your sight, O Lord, show this also to your servant, whether after death, even now when every one of us gives up his soul, we will be kept in rest until those times come, in which you renew the creation, or whether we will be tormented immediately.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V76">76&#160;</span>He answered me, “I will show you this also;

For though it was you who sinned, the evil hasn’t fallen on you alone, but on all of us who come from you.  <span class="verse" id="V119">119&#160;</span>For what profit is it to us, if an immortal time is promised to us, but we have done deeds that bring death?  <span class="verse" id="V120">120&#160;</span>And that there is promised us an everlasting hope, but we have most miserably failed?  <span class="verse" id="V121">121&#160;</span>And that there are reserved habitations of health and safety, but we have lived wickedly?  <span class="verse" id="V122">122&#160;</span>And that the glory of the Most High will defend those who have led a pure life, but we have walked in the most wicked ways of all?  <span class="verse" id="V123">123&#160;</span>And that a paradise will be revealed, whose fruit endures without decay, in which is abundance and healing, but we won’t enter into it,  <span class="verse" id="V124">124&#160;</span>for we have lived in perverse ways?  <span class="verse" id="V125">125&#160;</span>And that the faces of those who have practiced self-control will shine more than the stars, but our faces will be blacker than darkness?  <span class="verse" id="V126">126&#160;</span>For while we lived and committed iniquity, we didn’t consider what we would have to suffer after death.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V127">127&#160;</span>Then he answered, “This is the significance of the battle which humans born on the earth will fight:  <span class="verse" id="V128">128&#160;</span>if they are overcome, they will suffer as you have said, but if they get the victory, they will receive the thing that I say.  <span class="verse" id="V129">129&#160;</span>For this is the way that Moses spoke to the people while he lived, saying, ‘Choose life, that you may live!’  <span class="verse" id="V130">130&#160;</span>Nevertheless they didn’t believe him or the prophets after him, not even me, who have spoken to them.  <span class="verse" id="V131">131&#160;</span>Therefore there won’t be such heaviness in their destruction, as there will be joy over those who are assured of salvation.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V132">132&#160;</span>Then I answered, “I know, Lord, that the Most High is now called merciful, in that he has mercy upon those who have not yet come into the world;  <span class="verse" id="V133">133&#160;</span>and compassionate, in that he has compassion upon those who turn to his law;  <span class="verse" id="V134">134&#160;</span>and patient, in that he is patient with those who have sinned, since they are his creatures;  <span class="verse" id="V135">135&#160;</span>and bountiful, in that he is ready to give rather than to take away;  <span class="verse" id="V136">136&#160;</span>and very merciful, in that he multiplies more and more mercies to those who are present, and who are past, and also to those who are to come—  <span class="verse" id="V137">137&#160;</span>for if he wasn’t merciful, the world wouldn’t continue with those who dwell in it—  <span class="verse" id="V138">138&#160;</span>and one who forgives, for if he didn’t forgive out of his goodness, that those who have committed iniquities might be relieved of them, not even one ten thousandth part of mankind would remain living;  <span class="verse" id="V139">139&#160;</span>and a judge, for if he didn’t pardon those who were created by his word, and blot out the multitude of sins,  <span class="verse" id="V140">140&#160;</span>there would perhaps be very few left of an innumerable multitude.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
