I brought him up to Mount Sinai, where I kept him with me for many days.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I told him many wondrous things, and showed him the secrets of the times and the end of the seasons. I commanded him, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>‘You shall publish these openly, and these you shall hide.’  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Now I say to you:  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Lay up in your heart the signs that I have shown, the dreams that you have seen, and the interpretations which you have heard;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>for you will be taken away from men, and from now on you will live with my Son and with those who are like you, until the times have ended.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For the world has lost its youth, and the times begin to grow old.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span> <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Verses 11, 12 are omitted in the Syriac.

For the world is set in darkness, and those who dwell in it are without light.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For your law has been burned, therefore no one knows the things that are done by you, or the works that will be done.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But if I have found favor before you, send the Holy Spirit to me, and I will write all that has been done in the world since the beginning, even the things that were written in your law, that men may be able to find the path, and that those who would live in the latter days may live.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>He answered me and said, “Go your way, gather the people together, and tell them not to seek you for forty days.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But prepare for yourself many tablets, and take with you Sarea, Dabria, Selemia, Ethanus, and Asiel, these five, which are ready to write swiftly;  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>and come here, and I will light a lamp of understanding in your heart which will not be put out until the things have ended about which you will write.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>When you are done, some things you shall publish openly, and some things you shall deliver in secret to the wise.
