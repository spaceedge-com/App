You didn’t pollute your sacred teeth, nor make your appetite, which had always embraced the clean and lawful, a partaker of profanity.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>O harmonizer with the law, and sage devoted to a divine life!  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Of such a character ought those to be who perform the duties of the law at the risk of their own blood, and defend it with generous sweat by sufferings even to death.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>You, father, have gloriously established our right government by your endurance; and making of much account our past service, prevented its destruction, and by your deeds, have made credible the words of philosophy.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>O aged man of more power than tortures, elder more vigorous than fire, greatest king over the emotions, Eleazar!  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For as father Aaron, armed with a censer, hastening through the consuming fire, vanquished the flame-bearing angel,  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>so, Eleazar, the descendant of Aaron, wasted away by the fire, didn’t give up his reasoning.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>What is most wonderful is that though he was an old man, though the labors of his body were now spent, his muscles were relaxed, and his sinews worn out, he recovered youth.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>By the spirit of reasoning, and the reasoning of Isaac, he rendered powerless the many-headed rack.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>O blessed old age, and reverend hoar head, and life obedient to the law, which the faithful seal of death perfected.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>If, then, an old man, through religion, despised tortures even to death, then certainly religious reasoning is ruler of the emotions.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But perhaps some might say, “It is not all who conquer emotions, as not all possess wise reasoning.”  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But those who have meditated upon religion with their whole heart, these alone can master the emotions of the flesh:  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>they who believe that to God they don’t die; for, as our forefathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, they live to God.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>This circumstance, then, is by no means an objection, that some who have weak reasoning are governed by their emotions,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>since what person, walking religiously by the whole rule of philosophy, and believing in God,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and knowing that it is a blessed thing to endure all kinds of hardships for virtue, would not, for the sake of religion, master his emotion?  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For only the wise and brave man is lord over his emotions.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>This is why even boys, trained with the philosophy of religious reasoning, have conquered still more bitter tortures;  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>for when the tyrant was manifestly vanquished in his first attempt, in being unable to force the old man to eat the unclean thing, </div><ul class='tnav'>
