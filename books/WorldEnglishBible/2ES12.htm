Therefore they are called the heads of the eagle.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For these are those who will accomplish her wickedness, and who will finish her last actions.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>You saw that the great head disappeared. It signifies that one of them will die on his bed, and yet with pain.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But for the two that remained, the sword will devour them.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For the sword of the one will devour him that was with him, but he will also fall by the sword in the last days.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>You saw two under wings passing <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> So the Syriac.

What evil have we done against you, that you have utterly forsaken us, and sit in this place?  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>For of all the prophets, only you are left to us, like a cluster of the vintage, and like a lamp in a dark place, and like a harbor for a ship saved from the tempest.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Aren’t the evils which have come to us sufficient?  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>If you will forsake us, how much better had it been for us if we also had been consumed in the burning of Zion!  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>For we are not better than those who died there.” Then they wept with a loud voice. I answered them,  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>“Take courage, O Israel!
