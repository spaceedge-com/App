He stationed sentinels around the camp.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The adversaries heard that Jonathan and his men were ready for battle, and they feared, and trembled in their hearts, and they kindled fires in their camp then withdrew.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But Jonathan and his men didn’t know it until the morning; for they saw the fires burning.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Jonathan pursued after them, but didn’t overtake them; for they had gone over the river Eleutherus.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then Jonathan turned toward the Arabians, who are called Zabadaeans, and struck them, and took their spoils.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>He came out from there, and came to Damascus, and took his journey through all the country. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Simon went out, and took his journey as far as Ascalon, and the strongholds that were near it. Then he turned toward Joppa and took possession of it;  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>for he had heard that they were planning to hand over the stronghold to Demetrius’ men. He set a garrison there to guard it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Then Jonathan returned and called the elders of the people together. He planned with them to build strongholds in Judea,  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>and to make the walls of Jerusalem higher, and to raise a great mound between the citadel and the city, to separate it from the city, that so it might be isolated, that its garrison might neither buy nor sell.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>They were gathered together to build the city. Part of the wall of the brook that is on the east side fell down, and he repaired the section called Chaphenatha.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Simon also built Adida in the<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr.

So he marched out and came to Bethshan.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Jonathan came out to meet him with forty thousand men chosen for battle, and came to Bethshan.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Tryphon saw that he came with a great army, and he was afraid to stretch out his hand against him.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>He received him honorably, and commended him to all his<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> See 1 Maccabees 2:18. </span></a> friends, and gave him gifts, and commanded his forces to be obedient to him, as to himself.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>He said to Jonathan, “Why have you put all this people to so much trouble, seeing there is no war between us?  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Now send them away to their homes, but choose for yourself a few men who shall be with you, and come with me to Ptolemais, and I will give it to you, and the rest of the strongholds and the rest of the forces, and all the king’s officers. Then I will turn around and depart; for this is why I came.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>He put his trust in him, and did even as he said, and sent away his forces, and they departed into the land of Judah.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>But he reserved to himself three thousand men, of whom he left two thousand in Galilee, but one thousand went with him.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Now as soon as Jonathan entered into Ptolemais, the people of Ptolemais shut the gates and seized him. They killed all those who came in with him with the sword. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Tryphon sent troops and cavalry into Galilee, and into the Great Plain, to destroy all Jonathan’s men.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>They perceived that he had been seized and had perished, along with those who were with him. They encouraged one another and went on their way close together, prepared to fight.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Those who followed them saw that they were ready to fight for their lives, and turned back again.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>They all came in peace into the land of Judah, and they mourned for Jonathan and those who were with him, and they were very afraid. All Israel mourned with a great mourning.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>And all the Gentiles who were around them sought to destroy them utterly; for they said, “They have no ruler nor anyone to help them. Now therefore let’s fight against them, and take away their memory from among men.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
