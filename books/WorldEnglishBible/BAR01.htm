<div class='mt'>BARUCH </div><div class='ip'>The book of <span class='bk'>Baruch</span> is recognized as Deuterocanonical Scripture by the Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Russian Orthodox Churches. In some Bibles, Baruch chapter 6 is listed as a separate book called <span class='bk'>The Letter of Jeremiah</span>, reflecting its separation from Baruch in some copies of the Greek Septuagint.

We will live under the shadow of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon and under the shadow of Baltasar his son, and we shall serve them many days, and find favor in their sight.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Pray for us also to the Lord our God, for we have sinned against the Lord our God. To this day the wrath of the Lord and his indignation is not turned from us.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>You shall read this book which we have sent to you, to make confession in the house of the Lord upon the day of the feast and on the days of the solemn assembly. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>You shall say: To the Lord our God belongs righteousness, but to us confusion of face, as at this day—to the men of Judah, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>to our kings, to our princes, to our priests, to our prophets, and to our fathers,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>because we have sinned before the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>We have disobeyed him and have not listened to the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in the commandments of the Lord that he has set before us.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Since the day that the Lord brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt to this present day, we have been disobedient to the Lord our God, and we have been negligent in not listening to his voice.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Therefore the plagues have clung to us, along with the curse which the Lord declared through Moses his servant in the day that he brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt to give us a land that flows with milk and honey, as at this day.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Nevertheless we didn’t listen to the voice of the Lord our God, according to all the words of the prophets whom he sent to us,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>but we each walked in the imagination of his own wicked heart, to serve strange gods and to do what is evil in the sight of the Lord our God. </div><ul class='tnav'>
