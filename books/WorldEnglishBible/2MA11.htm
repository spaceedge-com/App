Lysias himself also escaped by shameful flight.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But as he was a man not void of understanding, pondering the defeat which had befallen him, and considering that the Hebrews could not be overcome because the Almighty God fought on their side, he sent again  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and persuaded them to come to terms on condition that all their rights were acknowledged, and <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> The Greek text here is corrupt. </span></a> promised that he would also persuade the king to become their friend.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Maccabaeus gave consent upon all the conditions which Lysias proposed to him, being careful of the common good; for whatever requests Maccabaeus delivered in writing to Lysias concerning the Jews the king allowed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The letter written to the Jews from Lysias was to this effect: </div><div class='p'>“Lysias to the <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. multitude. </span></a>people of the Jews, greetings.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>John and Absalom, who were sent from you, having delivered the document written below, made request concerning the things written therein.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Whatever things therefore needed to be brought before the king I declared to him, and what things were possible he allowed.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>If then you will all preserve your good will toward the government, I will also endeavor in the future to contribute to your good.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Concerning this, I have given order in detail, both to these men and to those who are sent from me, to confer with you.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Farewell.
