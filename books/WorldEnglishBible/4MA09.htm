<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 9</div><div class='nb'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>“Why do you delay, O tyrant? For we are more ready to die than to transgress the injunctions of our fathers.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>We would be disgracing our fathers if we didn’t obey the law, and take knowledge for our guide.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>O tyrant, counselor of law-breaking, do not, hating us as you do, pity us more than we pity ourselves.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For we consider your escape to be worse than death.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>You try to scare us by threatening us with death by tortures, as though you had learned nothing by the death of Eleazar.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But if aged men of the Hebrews have died in the cause of religion after enduring torture, more rightly should we younger men die, scorning your cruel tortures, which our aged instructor overcame.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Make the attempt, then, O tyrant. If you put us to death for our religion, don’t think that you harm us by torturing us.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For we through this ill-treatment and endurance will gain the rewards of virtue.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But you, for the wicked and despotic slaughter of us, will, from the Divine vengeance, endure eternal torture by fire.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>When they had said this, the tyrant was not only exasperated against them for being disobedient, but enraged with them for being ungrateful.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>So, at his bidding, the torturers brought the oldest of them, and tearing through his tunic, bound his hands and arms on each side with thongs.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>When they had labored hard without effect in scourging him, they hurled him on the wheel.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The noble youth, extended upon this, became dislocated.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>With every member disjointed, he denounced the tyrant, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>“O most accursed tyrant, and enemy of heavenly justice, and cruel-hearted, I am no murderer, nor sacrilegious man, whom you torture, but a defender of the Divine law.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And when the spearmen said, “Consent to eat, that you may be released from your tortures,”  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>he answered, “Not so powerful, O accursed lackeys, is your wheel, as to stifle my reasoning. Cut my limbs, and burn my flesh, and twist my joints.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For through all my torments I will convince you that the children of the Hebrews are alone unconquered on behalf of virtue.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>While he was saying this, they heaped up fuel, and setting fire to it, strained him on the wheel still more.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The wheel was defiled all over with blood. The hot ashes were quenched by the droppings of gore, and pieces of flesh were scattered about the axles of the machine.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Although the framework of his bones was now destroyed, the high-minded and Abrahamic youth didn’t groan.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But, as though transformed by fire into immortality, he nobly endured the rackings, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>“Imitate me, O kindred. Never desert your station, nor renounce my brotherhood in courage. Fight the holy and honorable fight of religion,  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>by which means our just and paternal Providence, becoming merciful to the nation, will punish the pestilent tyrant.”  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Saying this, the revered youth abruptly closed his life. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>When all admired his courageous soul, the spearmen brought forward him who was second oldest, and having put on iron gauntlets with sharp hooks, bound him to the rack.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>When, on enquiring whether he would eat before he was tortured, they heard his noble sentiment.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>After they with the iron gauntlets had violently dragged all the flesh from the neck to the chin, the panther-like animals tore off the very skin of his head, but he, bearing with firmness this misery, said,  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>“How sweet is every form of death for the religion of our fathers!” Then he said to the tyrant,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>“Don’t you think, most cruel of all tyrants, that you are now tortured more than I, finding your arrogant conception of tyranny conquered by our perseverance in behalf of our religion?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For I lighten my suffering by the pleasures which are connected with virtue.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But you are tortured with threatenings for impiety. You won’t escape, most corrupt tyrant, the vengeance of Divine wrath.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
