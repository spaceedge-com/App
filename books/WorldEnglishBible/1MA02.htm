Why was I born to see the destruction of my people and the destruction of the holy city, and to dwell there when it was given into the hand of the enemy, the sanctuary into the hand of foreigners?  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Her temple has become like a man who was glorious.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Her vessels of glory are carried away into captivity.

Her young men are slain with the enemy’s sword.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>What nation has not inherited her palaces and taken possession of her spoils?  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Her adornment has all been taken away. Instead of a free woman, she has become a slave.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Behold, our holy things, our beauty, and our glory are laid waste. The Gentiles have profaned them.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Why should we live any longer?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Mattathias and his sons tore their clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourned exceedingly. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the king’s officers who were enforcing the apostasy came into the city Modin to sacrifice.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Many of Israel came to them, and Mattathias and his sons were gathered together.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The king’s officers answered and spoke to Mattathias, saying, “You are a ruler and an honorable and great man in this city, and strengthened with sons and kindred.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Now therefore come first and do the commandment of the king, as all the nations have done, including the men of Judah and those who remain in Jerusalem.

Come out and do according to the word of the king, and you will all live!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>They said, “We won’t come out. We won’t do the word of the king, to profane the Sabbath day.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Then the enemy hurried to attack them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>They didn’t answer them. They didn’t cast a stone at them, or block their secret places,  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>saying, “Let’s all die in our innocence. Heaven and earth testify for us, that you put us to death unjustly.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>So they attacked them on the Sabbath, and they died—they, their wives, their children, and their livestock—in number a thousand souls of men. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>When Mattathias and his friends found out about it, and they mourned over them exceedingly.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>One said to another, “If we all do as our kindred have done, and don’t fight against the Gentiles for our lives and our ordinances, they will quickly destroy us from off the earth.”  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>So they decided that day, saying, “Whoever comes against us to battle on the Sabbath day, let’s fight against him, and we will in no way all die, as our kindred died in the secret places.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Then a company of the Hasidaeans,<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> That is, Chasidim. </span></a> mighty men of Israel, everyone who offered himself willingly for the law, were gathered together to them.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>All those who fled from the evils were added to them, and supported them.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>They mustered an army, and struck sinners in their anger, and lawless men in their wrath. The rest fled to the Gentiles for safety.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And Mattathias and his friends went around and pulled down the altars.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>They forcibly circumcised the boys who were uncircumcised, as many as they found in the coasts of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>They pursued the arrogant, and the work prospered in their hand.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>They rescued the law out of the hand of the Gentiles and out of the hand of the kings. They never allowed the sinner to triumph. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>The days of Mattathias drew near that he should die, and he said to his sons, “Now pride and scorn have gained strength.
