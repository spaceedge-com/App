</div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>In the shaking of a sieve, the refuse remains, </div><div class='q2'>so does the filth of man in his thoughts. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The furnace tests the potter’s vessels; </div><div class='q2'>so the test of a person is in his thoughts. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The fruit of a tree discloses its cultivation, </div><div class='q2'>so is the utterance of the thought of a person’s heart. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Praise no man before you hear his thoughts, </div><div class='q2'>for this is how people are tested. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>If you follow righteousness, you will obtain it, </div><div class='q'>and put it on like a long robe of glory. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Birds will return to their own kind, </div><div class='q2'>so truth will return to those who practice it. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The lion lies in wait for prey. </div><div class='q2'>So does sin for those who do evil. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The discourse of a godly man is always wise, </div><div class='q2'>but the fool changes like the moon. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Limit your time among people void of understanding, </div><div class='q2'>but persevere among the thoughtful. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The talk of fools is offensive. </div><div class='q2'>Their laughter is wantonly sinful. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Their talk with much swearing makes hair stand upright. </div><div class='q2'>Their strife makes others plug their ears. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The strife of the proud leads to bloodshed. </div><div class='q2'>Their abuse of each other is a grievous thing to hear. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He who reveals secrets destroys trust, </div><div class='q2'>and will not find a close friend. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Love a friend, and keep faith with him; </div><div class='q2'>but if you reveal his secrets, </div><div class='q2'>you shall not follow him; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>for as a man has destroyed his enemy, </div><div class='q2'>so you have destroyed the friendship of your neighbor. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>As a bird which you have released out of your hand, </div><div class='q2'>so you have let your neighbor go, and you will not catch him again. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Don’t pursue him, for he has gone far away, </div><div class='q2'>and has escaped like a gazelle out of the snare. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For a wound may be bound up, and after abuse there may be reconciliation; </div><div class='q2'>but he who reveals secrets is without hope. </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>One who winks the eye contrives evil things;
