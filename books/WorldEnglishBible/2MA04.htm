The men whose ways of living they earnestly followed, and to whom they desired to be made like in all things, these became their enemies and punished them.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For it is not a light thing to show irreverence to God’s laws, but later events will make this clear. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Now when certain games that came every fifth year were kept at Tyre, and the king was present,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>the vile Jason sent sacred envoys,<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> See ver. 9.</span></a> as being Antiochians of Jerusalem, bearing three hundred drachmas of silver to the sacrifice of Hercules, which even the bearers thereof thought not right to use for any sacrifice, because it was not fit, but to spend it for another purpose.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Although the intended purpose of the sender this money was for the sacrifice of Hercules, yet on account of <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Some authorities read the bearers. </span></a>present circumstances it went to the construction of trireme warships. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Now when Apollonius the son of Menestheus was sent into Egypt for the <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> The exact meaning of the Greek word is uncertain.</span></a> enthronement of Philometor as king, Antiochus, learning that Philometor had shown himself hostile toward the government, took precautions for the security of his realm. Therefore, going to Joppa, he travelled on to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Being magnificently received by Jason and the city, he was brought in with torches and shouting. Then he led his army down into Phoenicia. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Now after a space of three years, Jason sent Menelaus, the previously mentioned Simon’s brother, to carry the money to the king, and to make reports concerning some necessary matters.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But he being commended to the king, and having been glorified by the display of his authority, secured the high priesthood for himself, outbidding Jason by three hundred talents of silver.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>After receiving the royal mandates, he returned bringing nothing worthy of the high priesthood, but having the passion of a cruel tyrant and the rage of a savage animal.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>So Jason, who had supplanted his own brother, was supplanted by another and driven as a fugitive into the country of the Ammonites,  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Menelaus had possession of the office; but of the money that had been promised to the king nothing was regularly paid, even though Sostratus the governor of the citadel demanded it—  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>for his job was the gathering of the revenues—so they were both called by the king to his presence.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Menelaus left his own brother Lysimachus for his<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Gr. successor. </span></a> deputy in the high priesthood; and Sostratus left Crates, who was over the Cyprians. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Now while this was the state of things, it came to pass that the people of Tarsus and Mallus revolted because they were to be given as a present to Antiochis, the king’s concubine.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>The king therefore quickly came to settle matters, leaving for his <a href="#FN8" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. successor. </span></a>deputy Andronicus, a man of high rank.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Then Menelaus, supposing that he had gotten a favorable opportunity, presented to Andronicus certain vessels of gold belonging to the temple, which he had stolen. He had already sold others into Tyre and the neighboring cities.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>When Onias had sure knowledge of this, he sharply reproved him, having withdrawn himself into a sanctuary at Daphne, that lies by Antioch.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Therefore Menelaus, taking Andronicus aside, asked him to kill Onias. Coming to Onias, and being persuaded to use treachery, and being received as a friend, Andronicus gave him his right hand with oaths and, though he was suspicious, persuaded him to come out of the sanctuary. Then, with no regard for justice, he immediately put him to death.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>For this reason not only Jews, but many also of the other nations, had indignation and displeasure at the unjust murder of the man.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And when the king had come back from the places in Cilicia, the Jews who were in the city appealed to him against Andronicus (the Greeks also joining with them in hatred of the wickedness), urging that Onias had been wrongfully slain.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Antiochus therefore was heartily sorry, and was moved to pity, and wept, because of the sober and well ordered life of him who was dead.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Being inflamed with anger, he immediately stripped off Andronicus’s purple robe, and tore off his under garments, and when he had led him round through the whole city to that very place where he had committed the outrage against Onias, there he put the murderer out of the way, the Lord rendering to him the punishment he had deserved. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Now when many sacrileges had been committed in the city by Lysimachus with the consent of Menelaus, and when the report of them had spread abroad outside, the people gathered themselves together against Lysimachus, after many vessels of gold had already been stolen.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>When the multitudes were rising against him and were filled with anger, Lysimachus armed about three thousand men, and with unrighteous violence began the attack under the leadership of Hauran, a man far gone in years and no less also in folly.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>But when they perceived the assault of Lysimachus, some caught up stones, others logs of wood, and some took handfuls of the ashes that lay near, and they flung them all in wild confusion at Lysimachus and those who were with him.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>As a result, they wounded many of them, they killed some, and they forced the rest of them to flee, but the author of the sacrilege himself they killed beside the treasury. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>But about these matters, there was an accusation laid against Menelaus.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>When the king had come to Tyre, the three men who were sent by the senate pleaded the cause before him.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>But Menelaus, seeing himself now defeated, promised much money to Ptolemy the son of Dorymenes, that he might win over the king.  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Therefore Ptolemy taking the king aside into a cloister, as if to get some fresh air, convinced him to change his mind.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>He who was the cause of all the evil, Menelaus, he discharged from the accusations; but these hapless men, who, if they had pleaded even before Scythians, would have been discharged uncondemned, them he sentenced to death.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Those who were spokesmen for the city and the families of Israel and the holy vessels soon suffered that unrighteous penalty.  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Therefore even certain Tyrians, moved with hatred of the wickedness, provided magnificently for their burial.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>But Menelaus, through the covetous dealings of those who were in power, remained still in his office, growing in wickedness, established as a great conspirator against his fellow-citizens. </div><ul class='tnav'>
