Just as when you ask the earth, it will say to you that it gives very much clay from which earthen vessels are made, but little dust that gold comes from. Even so is the course of the present world.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Many have been created, but few will be saved.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I answered, “Drink your fill of understanding then, O my soul, and let my heart devour wisdom.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For you <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> So the Syriac.

When the womb gives up again what has grown in it,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>you have commanded that out of the parts of the body, that is to say, out of the breasts, be given milk, which is the fruit of the breasts,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>that the body that is fashioned may be nourished for a time, and afterwards you guide it in your mercy.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Yes, you have brought it up in your righteousness, nurtured it in your law, and corrected it with your judgment.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>You put it to death as your creation, and make it live as your work.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>If therefore you <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> So the Syriac.

Or what is a corruptible race, that you should be so bitter toward it?  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>For in truth, there is no man among those who are born who has not done wickedly, and among those who have lived, there is none which have not done wrong.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>For in this, O Lord, your righteousness and your goodness will be declared, if you are merciful to those who have no store of good works.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Then he answered me, “Some things you have spoken rightly, and it will happen according to your words.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>For indeed I will not think about the fashioning of those who have sinned, or about their death, their judgment, or their destruction;  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>but I will rejoice over the creation of the righteous and their pilgrimage, their salvation, and the reward that they will have.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Therefore as I have spoken, so it will be.  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>For as the farmer sows many seeds in the ground, and plants many trees, and yet not all that is sown will <a href="#FN9" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Lat. be saved. </span></a>come up in due season, neither will all that is planted take root, even so those who are sown in the world will not all be saved.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Then I answered, “If I have found favor, let me speak before you.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>If the farmer’s seed doesn’t come up because it hasn’t received your rain in due season, or if it is ruined by too much rain and perishes,  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>likewise man, who is formed with your hands and is called your own image, because he is made like you, for whose sake you have formed all things, even him have you made like the farmer’s seed.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Don’t be angry with us, but spare your people and have mercy upon your inheritance, for you have mercy upon your own creation.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Then he answered me, “Things present are for those who live now, and things to come for those who will live hereafter.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>For you come far short of being able to love my creature more than I. But you have compared yourself to the unrighteous. Don’t do that!  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Yet in this will you be admirable to the Most High,  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>in that you have humbled yourself, as it becomes you, and have not judged yourself among the righteous, so as to be much glorified.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>For many grievous miseries will fall on those who dwell in the world in the last times, because they have walked in great pride.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>But understand for yourself, and for those who inquire concerning the glory of those like you,  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>because paradise is opened to you. The tree of life is planted. The time to come is prepared. Plenteousness is made ready. A city is built. Rest is <a href="#FN10" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> The Syriac has established. </span></a>allowed. Goodness is perfected, and wisdom is perfected beforehand.  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>The root of evil is sealed up from you. Weakness is done away from you, and <a href="#FN11" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> After the chief Oriental versions. </span></a>death is hidden. Hell and corruption have fled into forgetfulness.  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>Sorrows have passed away, and in the end, the treasure of immortality is shown.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>Therefore ask no more questions concerning the multitude of those who perish.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>For when they had received liberty, they despised the Most High, scorned his law, and forsook his ways.  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>Moreover they have trodden down his righteous,  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>and said in their heart that there is no God—even knowing that they must die.  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>For as the things I have said will welcome you, so thirst and pain which are prepared for them. For the Most High didn’t intend that men should be destroyed,  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>but those who are created have themselves defiled the name of him who made them, and were unthankful to him who prepared life for them.  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>Therefore my judgment is now at hand,  <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>which I have not shown to all men, but to you, and a few like you.” </div><div class='p'>Then I answered,  <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>“Behold, O Lord, now you have shown me the multitude of the wonders which you will do in the last times, but you haven’t shown me when.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
