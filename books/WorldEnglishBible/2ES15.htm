Don’t let the unbelief of those who speak against you trouble you.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For all the unbelievers will die in their unbelief. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>“Behold,” says the Lord, “I bring evils on the whole earth: sword, famine, death, and destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For wickedness has prevailed over every land, and their hurtful works have reached their limit.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Therefore,” says the Lord,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>“I will hold my peace no more concerning their wickedness which they profanely commit, neither will I tolerate them in these things, which they wickedly practice. Behold, the innocent and righteous blood cries to me, and the souls of the righteous cry out continually.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I will surely avenge them,” says the Lord, “and will receive to me all the innocent blood from among them.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Behold, my people is led like a flock to the slaughter. I will not allow them now to dwell in the land of Egypt,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>but I will bring them out with a mighty hand and with a high arm, and will strike Egypt with plagues, as before, and will destroy all its land.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Let Egypt and its foundations mourn, for the plague of the chastisement and the punishment that God will bring upon it.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Let the farmers that till the ground mourn, for their seeds will fail and their trees will be ruined through the blight and hail, and a terrible tempest.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Woe to the world and those who dwell in it!  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For the sword and their destruction draws near, and nation will rise up against nation to battle with weapons in their hands.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For there will be sedition among men, and growing strong against one another. In their might, they won’t respect their king or the chief of their great ones.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For a man will desire to go into a city, and will not be able.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For because of their pride the cities will be troubled, the houses will be destroyed, and men will be afraid.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>A man will have no pity on his neighbors, but will assault their houses with the sword and plunder their goods, because of the lack of bread, and for great suffering. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>“Behold,” says God, “I call together all the kings of the earth to stir up those who are from the rising of the sun, from the south, from the east, and Libanus, to turn themselves one against another, and repay the things that they have done to them.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Just as they do yet this day to my chosen, so I will do also, and repay into their bosom.” The Lord God says:  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>“My right hand won’t spare the sinners, and my sword won’t cease over those who shed innocent blood on the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>A fire has gone out from his wrath and has consumed the foundations of the earth and the sinners, like burnt straw.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Woe to those who sin and don’t keep my commandments!” says the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>“I will not spare them. Go your way, you rebellious children! Don’t defile my sanctuary!”  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For the Lord knows all those who trespass against him, therefore he will deliver them to death and destruction.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For now evils have come upon the whole earth, and you will remain in them; for God will not deliver you, because you have sinned against him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Behold, a horrible sight appearing from the east!  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The nations of the dragons of Arabia will come out with many chariots. From the day that they set out, their hissing is carried over the earth, so that all those who will hear them may also fear and tremble.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Also the Carmonians, raging in wrath, will go out like the wild boars of the forest. They will come with great power and join battle with them, and will devastate a portion of the land of the Assyrians with their teeth.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then the dragons will have the upper hand, remembering their nature. If they will turn themselves, conspiring together in great power to persecute them,  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>then these will be troubled, and keep silence through their power, and will turn and flee.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>From the land of the Assyrians, an enemy in ambush will attack them and destroy one of them. Upon their army will be fear and trembling, and indecision upon their kings. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Behold, clouds from the east, and from the north to the south! They are very horrible to look at, full of wrath and storm.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>They will clash against one another. They will pour out a heavy storm on the earth, even their own storm. There will be blood from the sword to the horse’s belly,  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>and to the thigh of man, and to the camel’s hock.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>There will be fearfulness and great trembling upon earth.

They will pour out over every high and lofty one a terrible storm,  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>fire, hail, flying swords, and many waters, that all plains may be full, and all rivers, with the abundance of those waters.  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>They will break down the cities and walls, mountains and hills, trees of the forest, and grass of the meadows, and their grain.  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>They will go on steadily to Babylon and destroy her.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>They will come to it and surround it. They will pour out the storm and all wrath on her. Then the dust and smoke will go up to the sky, and all those who are around it will mourn for it.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Those who remain will serve those who have destroyed it. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>You, Asia, who are partaker in the beauty of Babylon, and in the glory of her person—  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>woe to you, you wretch, because you have made yourself like her. You have decked out your daughters for prostitution, that they might please and glory in your lovers, which have always lusted after you!  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>You have followed her who is hateful in all her works and inventions. Therefore God says,  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>“I will send evils on you: widowhood, poverty, famine, sword, and pestilence, to lay waste your houses and bring you to destruction and death.  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>The glory of your power will be dried up like a flower when the heat rises that is sent over you.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>You will be weakened like a poor woman who is beaten and wounded, so that you won’t be able to receive your mighty ones and your lovers.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>Would I have dealt with you with such jealousy,” says the Lord,  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>“if you had not always slain my chosen, exalting and clapping of your hands, and saying over their dead, when you were drunk? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>“Beautify your face!  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>The reward of a prostitute will be in your bosom, therefore you will be repaid.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>Just as you will do to my chosen,” says the Lord, “even so God will do to you, and will deliver you to your adversaries.  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>Your children will die of hunger.
