but greatest and first was their fear for the consecrated sanctuary.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Also those who were shut up in the city were in no light distress, being troubled because of the encounter in the open country. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>When all were now waiting for the decision of the issue, and the enemy had already joined battle, and the army had been set in array, and the elephants<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. animals. </span></a> brought back to a convenient post,<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup"> Or, stationed for convenient action </span></a> and the cavalry deployed on the flanks,  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Maccabaeus, perceiving the presence of the <a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§<span class="popup"> Gr. multitudes. </span></a>troops, and the various weapons with which they were equipped, and the savageness of the <a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Gr. animals. </span></a>elephants, holding up his hands to heaven called upon the Lord who works wonders, knowing that success comes not by weapons, but that, according to how the Lord judges, he gains the victory for those who are worthy.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And calling upon God, he said this: “You, O Sovereign Lord, sent your angel in the time of King Hezekiah of Judea, and he killed of the <a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Gr. camp. </span></a>army of Sennacherib as many as one hundred eighty-five thousand.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>So now also, O Sovereign of the heavens, send a good angel before us to bring terror and trembling.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Through the greatness of your arm let them be stricken with dismay who with blasphemy have come here against your holy people.” As he finished these words,  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Nicanor and his company advanced with trumpets and victory songs;  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>but Judas and his company joined battle with the enemy with invocation and prayers.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Fighting with their hands and praying to God with their hearts, they killed no less than thirty-five thousand men, being made exceedingly glad by the manifestation of God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>When the engagement was over and they were returning again with joy, they recognized Nicanor lying dead in full armor.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then there was shouting and noise, and they blessed the Sovereign Lord in the language of their ancestors.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>He who in all things was in body and soul the foremost champion of his fellow-citizens, he who kept through life the good will of his youth toward his countrymen, ordered that Nicanor’s head be cut off with his hand and arm, and that they be brought to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>When he had arrived there and had called his countrymen together and set the priests before the altar, he sent for those who were in the citadel.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Showing the head of the vile Nicanor and the hand of that profane man, which with proud brags he had stretched out against the holy house of the Almighty,  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>and cutting out the tongue of the impious Nicanor, he said that he would give it in pieces to the birds, and hang up these rewards of his folly near the sanctuary.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>They all, looking up to heaven, blessed the Lord who had manifested himself, saying, “Blessed is he who has preserved his own place undefiled!”  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>He hung Nicanor’s head and shoulder from the citadel, a clear sign evident to all of the help of the Lord.  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>They all ordained with a common decree to in no way let this day pass undistinguished, but to mark with honor the thirteenth day of the twelfth month (it is called Adar in the Syrian language), the day before the day of Mordecai. </div><div class='b'> &#160;
