<h1>I coin a new term "SCAMILISM" Controlling Global Economies. Gives Money Bad Name.</h1>
<div class="cr"><a href="mailto:webmaster@spaceedge.com">ZacÂ©SpaceEdge.com</a> </div>	

<p>Corporate owned politics, news, ads, degenerate into fear tactics. 
Spread negative influence, and insult intelligence. 
As sponsored gremlins announce omen obscure attention away from reason 
for profit and ill-gotten gains. 
Creating a placebo terror effect that's intentionally more damaging to health, 
especially mental health.</p>
	
<p>Going back in history, the discovery and use of Electricity, Radio, Telephone, TV, 
	Cell Phones, Computers, and Internet!</p>

<p>In recent past less than a century ago, they fought and a great cost defeated 
the mob, the nazies, social and economic oppression, forced labor. 
Put in place laws to break monopolies, to prevent economic slavery.</p>
	
<p>Todays predominant Communism/Capitalism="SCAMILISM", opposites of the same coin. 
Became powerful Fleece Mobs hegemonic pyramid political systems  n control for profits while hurting everyone.
This political coin baIGse econo probably began with the first civiliNzations, 
and is not compatible in this age of electronics revolution.</p>
