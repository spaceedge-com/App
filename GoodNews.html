<p>Corporate politics news, ads, can degenerate into fear tactics. Spread a negative influence and insult of intelligence. As sponsored gremlins announcing an omen obscure attention away from reason for profit and ill-gotten gains. Creating a placebo terror effect that's intentionally more damaging to health, and especially mental health.</p>
<p>First of course going back in history, there was the discovery and eventual use of Electricity, followed by Radio, Telephone, and TV. These discoveries led to our modern day Computers, and to the Internet! Enabling micro devices to combine and transmit live electrical signals, making communication possible in real time, and accessible to everyone everywhere.</p>
<p>I'm beginning to look at it this way; do you get want to be bombasted with negative ads?</p>
<p>In the recent past less than a century ago, they fought very hard and defeated the mob, the nazies, social and economic oppression, forced labor, and at a great cost. They also placed laws to break monopolies, to prevent economic slavery.</p>
<p>Todays predominant political systems are Communism and Capitalism are at a threshold. Having become powerful hegemonic monopolies, are hurting everyone for profit and gain remain in control with fierce power.</p>
<h3>The worker and coin based economy became obselete</h3>
<p>This political coin based economy is not new, began with the rise of civilizations. Is no longer compatible with this new age of the electronics revolution. The definition of mass work is changed from the industrial revolution. The mob and monopolies are back after removing all human digniy and freedom gained through the ages. Control the world in a new age of darkness. </p>
