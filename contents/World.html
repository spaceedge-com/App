<h3>Fake News FEAR the Unknown</h3>
<p><quote>
Revelation 11 18  And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the
dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy
servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small
and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth. <br>
<br>
1 John 4 17  Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of
judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.
18 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear
hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.<br>
<br>
2 Timothy 1 7  For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love,
and of a sound mind. <br>
