   <h3>Ads started out good, degenerate into harmful abuse, insult of intelligence for deep profits.</h3>
    <p>They're like gremlins, every now and then one gets in, obscuring attention away from the reason.</p>
    <p>First of course you have Electricity. Followed by Radio signals, Telephones, and TV. These discoveries led modern smart devices, computers, and especially the Internet. That combine and transmit signals to communicate in real time.</p>
    <p>I'm beginning to look at it this way; If you're talking on the phone do you get bombasted with ads?</p>
    <p>In the recent past they fought very hard and defeated the mob, the nazies, at great cost. They also had in place laws to break monopolies, social oppression, and slavery.</p>
    <p>These economic models while good at creating and serving monopolies. Communism/Capitalism, are just the same form of cronyism. Exploiting mankind for profits, hurts the little guy, and the majority of helpless people.</p> 
    <p>These predatory models began with the rise of civilizations, are outdated and should be replaced!!</p> 
  <p>The Bible, 10 Commandments, and the US Constitution are a great example of Freedom of the people for the people; if they don't disregard-it?</p>

  <p><em>James 1: 26 If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue,
but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.<br>
  27 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit
the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world."</em><cite> ‣ Bible(KJV) </cite></p>
  <p><em>"1 Corinthians 9: 9 For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?"</em><cite> ‣ Bible(KJV) </cite></p>
  
  <p><em>"God hath set Labor and rest, as day and night, to men Successive."</em><cite> ‣ Milton. [1913 Webster]</p>

  <p>Every able living person should be given work, toil or labor(non-slave labor), and for his efforts a living wage.</p>
