   <h3>Ads-Mob-News, degenerate into harmful fear tactics, insult of intelligence, for deep profits.</h3>
    <p>They're appear like gremlins, every now and then, obscuring attention away from the reason.</p>
    <p>First of course, you have the discovery of Electricity, followed by Radio signals, Telephones, and TV. These discoveries led modern smart devices, computers, and especially the Internet. That combine and transmit signals to communicate in real time.</p>
    <p>I'm beginning to look at it this way; If you're talking on the phone do you get bombasted with ads?</p>
    <p>In the recent past they fought very hard and defeated the mob, the nazies, at great cost. They also had in place laws to break monopolies, social oppression and economic slavery.</p>
    <p>These economic models while good at creating and serving monopolies. Communism/Capitalism are just a form of cronyism. Exploiting the majority for profits. Hurting the little guy, the helpless and the dis-advantaged.</p> 
    <p>These predatory models began with the rise of civilizations, are outdated and should be replaced!!</p> 
  <p>The Bible, 10 Commandments, and the US Constitution are a great example of Freedom of the people for the people; if they don't disregard-it?</p>

  <p><em>James 1: "26 If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue,
but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.<br>
  27 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world."</em><cite> ‣ Bible(KJV) </cite></p>
  <p><em>1 Corinthians 9: "9 For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?"</em><cite> ‣ Bible(KJV) </cite></p>
  
  <p><em>"God hath set Labor and rest, as day and night, to men Successive."</em><cite> ‣ J. Milton</cite></p>
	  
  <p><em>"The bureaucracy is expanding to meet the needs of an expanding bureaucracy."</em><cite> ‣ Unknown</cite></p>

  <p><em>Every able/unable person can work, toil, labor(non wage-slave/forced labor), for his efforts receive a living wage.</em><cite> ‣ Z</cite></p>
