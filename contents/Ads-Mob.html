   <h3>Ads started out good, degenerate into harmful abuse of people against deep proifits.
   </h3>
    <p>They're like gremlins, every now and then one gets in, obscuring attention away from the reason.</p>
    <p>First of course you have Electricity. Followed by Radio signals, Telephones, and TV. These discoveries led modern smart devices, computers, and especially the Internet. That combine and transmit signals to communicate in real time.</p>
    <p>I'm beginning to look at it this way; If you're talking on the phone do you get bombasted with ads?</p>
    <p>In the past they fought hard and defeated the mob, and the nazies, at a great cost. They also had in place laws to break monopolies.</p>
    <p>These economic models while good at serving monopolies. Communism vs/or Capitalism, are just the same form of cronyism. Exploiting mankind for profit, hurts the little guy, and the majority of people. These predatory models began with the rise of civilizations, are outdated and should be replaced!!</p>
