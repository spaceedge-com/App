   <h3>Ads started out good, degenerate into harmful abuse, and insult of intelligence, for deep profits.</h3>
    <p>They're like gremlins, every now and then one gets in, obscuring attention away from the reason.</p>
    <p>First of course you have Electricity. Followed by Radio signals, Telephones, and TV. These discoveries led modern smart devices, computers, and especially the Internet. That combine and transmit signals to communicate in real time.</p>
    <p>I'm beginning to look at it this way; If you're talking on the phone do you get bombasted with ads?</p>
    <p>In the recent past they fought very hard and defeated the mob, the nazies, at great cost. They also had in place laws to break monopolies, social oppression, and slavery.</p>
    <p>These economic models while good at creating and serving monopolies. Communism/Capitalism, are just the same form of cronyism. Exploiting mankind for profits, hurts the little guy, and the majority of helpless people.</p> 
    <p>These predatory models began with the rise of civilizations, are outdated and should be replaced!!</p> 
  <p>The Bible, 10 Commandments, and the US Constitution are a great example of Freedom of the people for the people; if they don't disregard-it?</p>
