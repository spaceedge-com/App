	 And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? 
	 They say unto him, Caesar's. 
	 Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; 
	 and unto God the things that are God's."</quote><cite> ‣ Bible(KJV) </cite>

    <p>Corporate Politics News, and Ads, can degenerate into fear tactics. Spread negative influence and insult of intelligence for profit. As a sponsored gremlin announcing an omen obscure attention away from reason for ill-gotten gains. Creating a placebo effect that's intentionally more damaging to health, especially mental health.</p>
    <p>First of course in history, the discovery and use of Electricity, followed by Radio signals, Telephone, and TV. These discoveries led to  Computers, and the Internet! Enabling micro devices to combine and transmit live electric signals, to communicate in real time.</p>
    <p>I'm beginning to look at it this way; If you're on the phone do you get bombasted with ads?</p>
    <p>In the recent past less than a century ago, they fought very hard and defeated the mob, the nazies, at a great cost. They also placed laws to break and prevent monopolies, social oppression, economic slavery and forced labor.</p>
    <p>Todays political systems Communism and Capitalism are at a threshold. Creating powerful, hegemonic monopolies. For profit hurt the poor, the dis-advantaged.</p>
    <p>The economics of today which are coin based began with the rise of civilizations. Are no longer compatible in this new electronics age. The definition of physical work has changed. The worker was replaced by machines, computers and robots. That are always on working day/night non-stop with very little assistance (e.g., mobile devices, satellites).</p> 
    <p>The Bible, 10 Commandments, and the US Constitution are a great example of God given gifts of Freedom to people; if they follow His laws, working unto God, and not man?</p>

    <p><quote>James 1: "26 If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.<br>
  27 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world."</quote><cite> ‣ Bible(KJV) </cite></p>
