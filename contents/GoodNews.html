	 And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?

    <h2>The Present World System</h2>
    <p>Corporate Politics News, Ads, can degenerate into fear tactics. Spread negative influence and an insult of intelligence for profit. As a sponsored gremlins announcing an omen obscure attention away from reason for their ill-gotten gains. Creating a placebo terror effect that's intentionally more damaging to health, especially mental health.</p>
    <p>First of course going back in history, there was the discovery and eventual use of Electricity. Followed by Radio signals, Telephone, and TV. These discoveries led to our modern day Computers, and Internet! Enabling micro devices to combine and transmit live electrical signals, making communication in real time accessible to everyone everywhere.</p>
    <p>I'm beginning to look at it this way; If you're on the phone do you get bombasted with ads?</p>
    <p>In the recent past less than a century ago, they fought very hard and defeated the mob, the nazies, at a great cost. They also placed laws to break and prevent monopolies, social oppression, economic slavery and forced labor.</p>
    <p>Todays predominant political systems are Communism and Capitalism are at a threshold. Having become powerful, hegemonic monopolies, are hurting everyone for profit and gain and remain in control with fierce power.</p>
    <h3>The worker became obselete</h3>
    <p>This political economy became coin based, is not new began with the rise of civilizations. Is not compatible with this new age of the electronics revolution. The definition of mass work is changed from the industrial revolution. The mob and monopolies are back after removing all human freedom gained through the ages, control the world in a new age of darkness. This antichrist political economy is using electronics, machines, computers, and robots that work non-stop with assistance from very few workers (e.g., gps, mobile devices). Until the return of our Lord to setup His everlasting Kingdom on earth.</p>

    <p>The Bible, 10 Commandments, and the US Constitution are a great example of God given gifts of Freedom to people; if they follow His laws, working to do His good will, and not greedy evil man?</p>

    <p><quote>"If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain. Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world."</quote><cite> ‣ Bible(KJV, James 1:26-27) </cite></p>
