    <p><em>"Matthew 22:17-21 Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not? 
	 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? 
	 Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny. 
	 And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? 
	 They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's."</em><cite> ‣ Bible(KJV) </cite>

    <p>Political Ads, and News, can degenerate into fear tactics, insult of intelligence, for ill-gotten gains. They'll appear like gremlins, obscuring attention away from the true reason.</p>
    <p>Today Mass Media Ads spread instant negative influnce. First of course, the discovery of Electricity, followed by Radio signals, Telephone, and TV. These discoveries led to modern day devices, computers, and especially the Internet. That combine signals and transmit, to communicate in real time.</p>
    <p>I'm beginning to look at it this way; If you're on the phone do you get bombasted with ads?</p>
    <p>In the recent past they fought very hard and defeated the mob, the nazies, at great cost. They also placed laws to break monopolies, social oppression and economic slavery.</p>
    <p>Todays economic model's Communism vs. Capitalism at their worst are creating and serving monopolies. Exploit the poor to profit. Hurting the little guy, and the dis-advantaged.</p> 
    <p>These economic models aren't new, began with the rise of civilizations, are outdated and should be replaced!!</p> 
  <p>The Bible, 10 Commandments, and the US Constitution are a great example of God given Gift of Freedom to the people; if they follow His laws?</p>

  <p><em>James 1: "26 If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.<br>
  27 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world."</em><cite> ‣ Bible(KJV) </cite></p>
  <p><em>1 Corinthians 9: "9 For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?"</em><cite> ‣ Bible(KJV) </cite></p>
  
  <p><em>"God hath set Labor and rest, as day and night, to men Successive."</em><cite> ‣ J. Milton</cite></p>

  <p><em>Every able person must work, of any kind of activity (not as in current slave economy/forced labor), all work is accounted for and receives a living wage.</em><cite> ‣ Z</cite></p>
