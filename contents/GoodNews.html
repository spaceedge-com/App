    <p><quote>"Matthew 22:17-21 Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not? 
	 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? 
	 Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny. 
	 And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? 
	 They say unto him, Caesar's. 
	 Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; 
	 and unto God the things that are God's."</quote><cite> ‣ Bible(KJV) </cite>

    <p>Political Corporate News, Ads, can degenerate into fear tactics, insult of intelligence, spread negative influence. As a gremlin announce an omen to obscure attention away from reason for ill-gotten gains. Creating a placebo effect that's intentionally more damaging to health, especially mental health.</p>
    <p>First of course, the discovery of Electricity, followed by Radio signals, Telephone, and TV. These discoveries led to  Computers, and the Internet! Enabling micro devices to combine and transmit live electric signals, to communicate in real time.</p>
    <p>I'm beginning to look at it this way; If you're on the phone do you get bombasted with ads?</p>
    <p>In the recent past less than a century ago, they fought very hard and defeated the mob, the nazies, at a great cost. They also placed laws to break and prevent monopolies, social oppression, economic slavery and forced labor.</p>
    <p>Todays economics models Communism/Capitalism are at their worst, creating and serving monopolies. Exploit for profit, hurt the poor, and the dis-advantaged.</p>
    <p>These economic models are coin based and began with the rise of civilizations. Are no longer compatible in this new electronics age. The definition of physical work has changed. The worker was replaced by machines, computers and robots. That are always on working day/night non-stop and need very little assistance. (e.g., mobile devices, satellites)</p> 
    <p>The Bible, 10 Commandments, and the US Constitution are a great example of God given gifts of Freedom to people; if they follow His laws, working unto God, and not man?</p>

    <p><quote>James 1: "26 If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.<br>
  27 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world."</quote><cite> ‣ Bible(KJV) </cite></p>
