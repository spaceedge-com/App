    <p><quote>"Matthew 22:17-21 Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not? 
	 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? 
	 Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny. 
	 And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? 
	 They say unto him, Caesar's. 
	 Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; 
	 and unto God the things that are God's."</quote><cite> ‣ Bible(KJV) </cite>

    <p>Political Ads, and News can degenerate into fear tactics, insult of intelligence, and spread negative influnce. Appear as a gremlin, obscure attention away from reason for ill-gotten gains. Create a placebo effect that's actually more damaging to health, especially mental health.</p>
    <p>First of course, the discovery of Electricity, followed by Radio signals, Telephone, and TV. These discoveries led to  Computers, and the Internet! Enabling micro devices to combine and transmit live electric signals, to communicate in real time.</p>
    <p>I'm beginning to look at it this way; If you're on the phone do you get bombasted with ads?</p>
    <p>In the recent past less than a century ago, they fought very hard and defeated the mob, the nazies, at a great cost. They also placed laws to break and prevent monopolies, social oppression, and economic slavery.</p>
    <p>These economic model's Communism/Capitalism are at their worst, creating and serving monopolies. Exploit the poor to profit, hurt the little guy, the dis-advantaged.</p>
    <p>Todays economic models are very old and outdated, began with the invention of coins at the rise of civilizations.</p>
    <p>These models are not compatible in this electronics age. The definition of physical work is changed. The worker was replaced by machines, robots, and computers, that need of very little assistance working day/night non-stop.</p> 
    <p>The Bible, 10 Commandments, and the US Constitution are a great example of God given gifts of Freedom to people; if they follow His laws, working unto God, not man?</p>

    <p><quote>James 1: "26 If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.<br>
  27 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world."</quote><cite> ‣ Bible(KJV) </cite></p>
